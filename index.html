				<h2>What is Spirited Away?</h2>
				<p>Spirited Away is a Studio Ghibli animated film where a young girl and her family move to a new house, but on their way they take a wrong turn and come upon an entrance to the Spirit Realm. With her mother and father transformed into pigs (and potential meals to the spirits who lurk around the corners), ten-year-old Chihiro must depend on the help of the inhabitants and workers of the Bathhouse, as well as her own courage, to survive, save her parents, and return to the human realm.</p>
